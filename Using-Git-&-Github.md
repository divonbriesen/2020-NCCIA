# 2020 NCCIA - Using Git & Github with your Students
## _Just Do It!_

_Session 1: Wednesday 9:00-10:15 Room 154_

_Session 10: Friday 10:30-11:45 Room 154_

We'll conduct a hands-on interactive exercise covering the basics of github and how to
get your students (and you) comfortable with using the world's leading version control tool
and site. Using a simple case-study based standard introductions, we'll together build up
a webpage that everyone can edit together. Please try to have your github account setup
and confirmed before the session.

### **_(Run off and make an account if you don't have one already)_**

## INTRO
- Github based on Git
- Linus Torvaldis created git after frustrations with existing (or non-existing) version control: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub
- Took two weeks and applied his unique mindset... so some stuff is a bit... odd
- Many use via CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Github (not to be confused with git) was a company built around providing repositories ("repos") using the git protocol.
- Microsoft paid $7 BILLION for github in 2018
- git and github have quickly moved to a dominant position in the version control space, with git now supported in a variety of environments and with many supporting tools, in addition to the original CLI

### SO WHAT?
- if your students graduate without version control experience you are doing them a disservice
- it makes all kinds of things a lot easier, including:
-- maintaining copies of projects in multiple locations
-- collaborating with students and between students
-- tracking and merging changes
-- creating public repos, including webpage support (and wikis and tasks and much more)

## TASKS
- Remember IGNORE and EXPLORE (IE)
- Create github account on http://github.com
- Login (and stay logged in to) your email
- Create a repo -
-- I suggest either NCCIA2020-LastnameFirstMI - i.e. NCCIA2020 von Briesen DI or
-- Course name in format YEAR-COURSEID-LastName or just COURSEID (i.e. CSC143-general or WEB110 von Briesen)
-- Github will put dashed wherever you have spaces in the repo name - you can change the name on the fly, but note what github changes your name to.
-- Choose options for creating a readme.md file and enabling web content
- Edit your readme file
-- check out MD (MarkDown) tutorials/cheatsheets: https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf - you can also use html
-- write something about your repo. 
- open up Github Desktop for Windows
-- login to your account
-- clone your repo
-- open your repo in visual studio and/or file explorer
-- create an index.html file with something simple like <h1>Yo! It's my repo webpage!!</h1>
-- save this file.
-- make a change to the readme.md file (i.e. "I edited this document on my computer, not on the web!!"). Save this file. 
-- note how the changes show up in github desktop. Commit changes (saves to repo) and push origin (pushes up to server). You cannot commit more than one file without updating the note (single files don't require a note/summary).
-- view your repo on it's website: http:/yourid.github.io/yourreponame
- Collaborate!
  - With me:
  - Start by cloning THIS repo (the one you're reading) - copy the ULR (start by going to github.com/divonbriesen and finding the repo, then copy the URL and paste it into the URL window of github desktop): https://github.com/divonbriesen/2020-NCCIA 
  - pull origin (copy down to your computer). 
  - open in visual studio code
  - edit RIGHT HERE in the read.me to add your name:
  - ATTENDEES (I use this with students:
    - D.I. von Briesen userid: divonbriesen was here 3/10/2020 at 10:14pm
    - Marlene Roden: userid marleneandersonroden was here 3.10.2020 at 10:00 am
    - and your name here
    - and your name here...
  - save and check github desktop - notice conflicts - to fix first pull origin, then view in visual studio code, and merge. Save, commit, and push origin. 
    - Need to invite collaborators (settings, collaborate- need to add users by their github id's). 
    - Use the id's from here to invite a couple people
    - They need to accept the invite - and then they'll be able to collaborate on your repo
    - add a file 
    - make a modification (i.e. go to the readme file and leave your mark :)) 

## SUMMARY
- Github and git are necessary skills in todays IT workforce
- these tools are free and offer a lot of great features:
  - collaboration
  - version control
  - web tools (webspace, wikis, etc...)
  - synchronization across devices
  - managing conflicts
  - tracking and sharing progress
- it can seem initimidating, but after use, it quickly becomes routine, and beats any other alternatives. 
- the integration with vs code is pretty cool
- you can make one as a class repository- imagine putting everything in github instead of within the LMS. It has many of the same features as a content management system, even though it's geared towards software projects.
